# select a CPU scheduler
#
# possible options & explaination:
# `bore`     is a modified EEVDF scheduler that is less fair with its scheduling in order to provide
#            better interactivity under load. recommended for desktop systems
# `bmq`      is a scheduler inspired by Google's Zircon. It is designed to be small. may benefit slow machines
#            by being more likely to fully fit in L1i cache. possibly less mature than EEVDF (or CFS) and as such
#            may not schedule as well under load (or in general?)
# `hardened` is just `bore` with some patches from linux-hardened. not supported by catgirl-edition
# `eevdf`    is the stock linux scheduler. it promises all tasks will get the CPU in an acceptable amount of time
#            provided that the CPU is not at 100% load. it is fully fair and is therefore the scheduler of choice
#            for server systems.
# `rt`       is a set of patches that run the `eevdf` scheduler to provide realtime latency (latency such as
#            the time between a car crash and airbags deploying). good for latency sensitive systems and systems
#            where latency need to be predictable
# `rt-bore`  is `rt` but runs the `bore` scheduler. more suited for desktop systems that for some reason need realtime
#            or predictable latency (like professional audio workstations.)
#
# note that it seems like realtime kernels probably wont help you lots if you play rhythm games
#
# this will only have a significant performance impact performance under load, as this affects which processes
# get the CPU.
#
# `bore` is a good choice. if you are building for a latency critical system (realtime), `rt` or `rt-bore` may
# work better if you are building for a server, set `eevdf` (the mainline linux kernel scheduler)
# latency critical servers should use `rt` instead of `rt-bore`.

# kernel preemption mode
#
# how should the kernel preempt?
# `full` preemption provides best responsiveness to apps by allowing all kernel code to be preempted[^1]
# `lazy` preemption provides good responsiveness by being less eager to preempt SCHED_NORMAL tasks
# `voluntary` preemption only preempts tasks at specific points. slightly worse latency than lazy, but better

# `none` (or also known as 'server') preemption provides best throughput by only allowing sysret and interrupts as
#        the only source of preemption. often you'll still get acceptable latency, but no promises are made.
#
# NOTE: this option is ignored if `_cpusched` is set to `rt` or `rt-bore`. in that case, all kernel code

# heap zeroing on allocation
#
# according to the documentation, disabling heap zeroing typically has <1% impact on workloads, but some synthetic (benchmark/stress)
# workloads have measured 7%.
#
# this may open up your system to information exposure exploits from previously
# used memory that has since been freed by other processes/threads. this means
# that freed memory may be freely accessable to other processes that happen to
# allocate those same regions of memory. these pieces of memory may include
# cryptographic keys or other sensitive information you want to be zeroed out.
#
# this often requires a purposely malicious or buggy program[^2] to impact your security.
#
# if unsure:
#     if you do not fully trust the apps running on your system[^1], say no
#     if building for an embedded system or system with code you trust, its safe[r] to say yes
#
# [^1]: for example, any applications with proprietary code
# [^2]: buggy as in exploitable from things like memory safety
: "${_no_heap_zeroing:=no}"

# disable stack zeroing
#
# this can improve latency and performance in cases where lots of threads are spawned
#
# same security advisory (the huge wall of text) as `_no_heap_zeroing`
#
# this often requires a purposely malicious or buggy program[^1] to impact your security.
#
# if unsure, follow advice from `_no_heap_zeroing`
#
# [^1]: buggy as in exploitable from things like memory safety
: "${_no_stack_zeroing:=no}"

# disable checking of integrity linked list manipulation
#
# this enables checking for linked-list manipulation. disabling may improve performance very slightly.
#
# interestingly, the linux kernel has this disabled by default, but arch kernel enables this.
#
# if unsure, say yes
: "${_no_checking_linkedlist_integrity:=no}"

# disable stack corruption on schedule()
#
# disables corruption checking. documentation states the performance overhead is minimal, so take as you will.
# if you have never encounted a kernel panic due to this, its probably safe to enable.
: "${_no_schedule_stack_corruption:=no}"

# disable stack protector
#
# disables the detection of a stack overflow in the kernel. this is a security feature that will call panic() if overflowed.
#
# the base CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR value increases kernel code size by 3%, and the additional CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
# value increases the kernel code size by another 2%
#
# i have never seen a stack overflow in kernel land, so it seems to be rare
# say yes only if you really need less ram usage
#
# if unsure, say no
: "${_no_stack_protector:=no}"

# disable kstack offset
#
# might improve performance idk lmao.
# makes memory corruption attacks that depend on stack address determinism or cross-syscall address exposures harder, if not flat out impossible
: "${_no_randomize_kstack_offset:=no}"

# disable IBT support
#
# disables Indirect Branch Tracking. having it enabled eliminates ENDBR instructions in the kernel, leading to very slightly better performance,
# lower ram usage and kernel size.
# typically the improvement is very marginal because CPUs are designed to deal with these.
#
# this is a security feature that prevents a malicious program from exploiting memory corruption bugs in the kernel
# to change the control flow of the kernel by telling the CPU that all indirect calls must land on ENDBR. such bugs
# require an existing memory corruption bug.
#
# saying yes here will make the build faster
#
# if unsure, say no
: "${_no_ibt:=no}"

# and thats basically it. after comes the logic
# prepare some bleach if you plan to scroll
